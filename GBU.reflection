                            GBU Reflection
I’m happy with how I handled the coding assignment independently. 
It helped me improve my problem-solving skills, and I felt accomplished when the core functionality of the program worked. 
However, I faced challenges with debugging, especially when I couldn’t immediately find a syntax error that was causing issues.
 It was frustrating to deal with, and at one point, I wasn’t sure how to fix it. But I learned that persistence is key, and breaking down the problem into smaller parts can help.
 Overall, the experience taught me a lot about patience and improving my debugging process, and I’m excited to apply these lessons in future projects.
